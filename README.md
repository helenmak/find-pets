# FindPets v.1.0.0

Current app version doesn`t support 'radius search', but I am working on it :).

To add new lost or found pet click on corresponding map control.
Then you have to point place where you lost or found an animal.
Fill in opened form and press 'Save' to save data or 'Cancel' to delete marker.

You can find any animal in already added data - on sidebar navigation menu choose type of animal you want
to find (all, lost or found), fill one or more of criterias and press 'Find'.

Pet data will be saved in your local storage.
